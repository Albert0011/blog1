    "text": "1. Building Your Foundations\n\na. Maths\nHonestly, this is the part where I struggle the most and at first thought that this was not going to be as important as coding. But let me tell you, it is very important in the world of data science. What you need to focus is learning about linear algebra, statistics, and some calculus. What you will learn here are key concepts like hypothesis testing, probability distributions, p-values, regression analysis and many more.\nFor me personally I like to learn using videos, these videos helped me a lot because it gives some visualizations so that learning math is not too abstract: The Essence of Linear Algebra The Essence of Calculus\nSome other materials: A course that I found entertaining\n\n\nb. Programming\nAfter understanding the math foundations, I will start on learning the essential skill of coding. In 2025, Python is still the most widely used language for data science. This is because it is very simple, easy to pick-up, lots and lots of libraries that are related to data science & AI. A lot of tools for visualization, and many more! Another language is R, but for me personally I donâ€™t really like R because I feel like using python is enough for my day to day basis. R is usually more widely used in research and academia, when you are doing a lot of statistical analysis, then R is definitely prefered.\nHere are my suggestions on courses and where to learn for Python: - Introduction to Python Programming from Coursera - Intro to Programming - Kaggle Python Tutorial - W3 Schools Python Tutorial\nHere are my suggestions on courses and where to learn for R: - Data Analysis with R Specialization - W3 Schools R Tutorial"
