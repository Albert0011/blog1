    "text": "1. Building Your Foundations\n\na. Maths\nHonestly, this is the part where I struggle the most and at first thought that this was not going to be as important as coding. But let me tell you, it is very important in the world of data science. What you need to focus is learning about linear algebra, statistics, and some calculus. What you will learn here are key concepts like hypothesis testing, probability distributions, p-values, regression analysis and many more.\nFor me personally I like to learn using videos, these videos helped me a lot because it gives some visualizations so that learning math is not too abstract:\n\nThe Essence of Linear Algebra\nThe Essence of Calculus\nMathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization\n\nSome other materials:\n\nA course that I found entertaining\n\n\n\nb. Programming\nAfter understanding the math foundations, I will start on learning the essential skill of coding. In 2025, Python is still the most widely used language for data science. This is because it is very simple, easy to pick-up, lots and lots of libraries that are related to data science & AI. A lot of tools for visualization, and many more! Another language is R, but for me personally I don’t really like R because I feel like using python is enough for my day to day basis. R is usually more widely used in research and academia, when you are doing a lot of statistical analysis, then R is definitely prefered.\nHere are my suggestions on courses and where to learn for Python:\n\nIntroduction to Python Programming from Coursera\nIntro to Programming\nKaggle Python Tutorial\nW3 Schools Python Tutorial\n\nHere are my suggestions on courses and where to learn for R:\n\nData Analysis with R Specialization\nW3 Schools R Tutorial\n\n\n\nc. Database and Data Wrangling\nOnce you understand the basics of programming, we can go and do a deep dive into the world of databases! I would recommend learning SQL and I think that is going to be enough. What I suggest you to learn is learning PostgreSQL which is open source. Here you will learn a lot about data storage, ability to clean, manipulate data, handling missing values, handling outliers, and many more!\n\nSQL Course for beginnners\nW3 Schools for PostgreSQL\nTutorials Point for PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nd. Machine Learning\nIt is not data science if we don’t touch machine learning right? Once you have the basic foundations of programming, data wrangling, statistics, we can now begin the fun part! Machine Learning. By using machine learning, we can learn from data, do predictions, and make decisions. The 3 key concepts that you will need to learn here are Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Deep Learning.\nHere are some my recommendations of courses:\n\nIntro to Machine Learning from Kaggle\nIntermediate Machine Learning from Kaggle\nMachine Learning Specialization with Andrew Ng!\nMachine Learning for Everybody\n\n\n\ne. Data Visualization\nAfter you make you gather your data, do some data wrangling, make your ML models, then what’s next? You want to show it to everybody right? Here is where Data Visualization comes in! Data visualization is the art of representing data in a visual format (e.g., charts, graphs) to help uncover patterns, trends, and insights. It’s an essential skill for data scientists, as it allows you to effectively communicate your findings to others. There are a LOT of choices here, for me personally, if we are using python then I would start with Matplotlib + Seaborn if you are from a CS background, and if you are not maybe you can start from Plotly or Altair. For R, ggplot2 is the best one!\nHere are some my recommendations but I would suggest to go to their documentations:\n\nFundamentals of Data Visualization by Claus O. Wilke\nAltair official website\nPlotly official website\nPython Seaborn Tutorial"

    "section": "2. Start a project",
    "text": "2. Start a project\nAfter finishing all those studies, what I would recommend to do next is just start a project! By doing so you can apply what you have learned so far and get the fruits of it. I usually likes to copy a project that someone has already made and make my own copy of it! Here is some project suggestions to start Data science projects. Another thing that I would do is go through kaggle, click a random project and see how they solve a problem. You can easily copy and see what other people are doing and it will definitely help. Trust me on this, if you don’t understand it, it is okay, just try it, it won’t hurt!"
