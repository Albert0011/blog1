In the recent years, data science has always been the top skills that people are getting into. It has been shaping many industries, from finance, healthcare, entertainment, and many more. Maybe you are interested in learning it today? The good news is, in 2025, it gets easier to learn it! In this blog post, I will try to give you a step by step structure on how to start learning data science in 2025. We will cover some key concepts, tools, resources, and learning strategies so that you can be a data scientist yourself!

# Why Data Science in 2025?

The world is changing. A lot of advancement in AI has been made this past few years. Data is the key of making AIs. The world is generating more and more data, and as it continues to grow exponentially, more professionals are needed to extact, clean, and make use of these datas. Any kinds of backgrounds can make use data science to make more advancements in their own fields, even if you are from a STEM or non-STEM backgrounds, it doesn't matter if you have the will!

# Where to start?

One of the most frequently asked question is where to start? Here is a good [Data Scientist Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist) that I found, you don't need to learn everything deeply and everything in one day, but make sure that you know the fundamentals of them. Remember that the most important thing here is your commitment to learning, this journey is not going to be easy, it will take you months to understand everything and just do it at your own pace!

## 1. Building Your Foundations
### a. Maths
Honestly, this is the part where I struggle the most and at first thought that this was not going to be as important as coding. But let me tell you, it is very important in the world of data science. What you need to focus is learning about linear algebra, statistics, and some calculus. What you will learn here are key concepts like hypothesis testing, probability distributions, p-values, regression analysis and many more. 

For me personally I like to learn using videos, these videos helped me a lot because it gives some visualizations so that learning math is not too abstract:

### b. Programming

![](Python-Logo.jpg)

After understanding the math foundations, I will start on learning the essential skill of coding. In 2025, Python is still the most widely used language for data science. This is because it is very simple, easy to pick-up, lots and lots of libraries that are related to data science & AI. A lot of tools for visualization, and many more! Another language is R, but for me personally I don't really like R because I feel like using python is enough for my day to day basis. R is usually more widely used in research and academia, when you are doing a lot of statistical analysis, then R is definitely prefered.

Here are my suggestions on courses and where to learn for Python:

- [Introduction to Python Programming from Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-programming-intro/paidmedia?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=B2C_NAMER_programming-python-java_penn_FTCOF_specializations_country-US-country-CA&campaignid=20859192865&adgroupid=155909119199&device=c&keyword=&matchtype=&network=g&devicemodel=&adposition=&creativeid=684305169997&hide_mobile_promo&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAv628BhC2ARIsAIJIiK_XDXWtk2BhTue02-M0TZ3N0GjyL5kzC2Y3IB1U7MB1oOKOlavGdFEaAr-yEALw_wcB)

- [Kaggle Python Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)

- [W3 Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)


Here are my suggestions on courses and where to learn for R:

- [Data Analysis with R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics/paidmedia?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=B2C_NAMER_statistics_duke_FTCOF_specializations_country-US-country-CA&campaignid=19997217497&adgroupid=149763243522&device=c&keyword=learn%20statistics&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adposition=&creativeid=655441924732&hide_mobile_promo&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAv628BhC2ARIsAIJIiK-543FPH1-NmtYhh5Jgoa9UBsB8f5OIUttLHg_MzGNCDNILXkP_RPQaAqCxEALw_wcB)

- [W3 Schools R Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/r/default.asp)

### c. Database and Data Wrangling

Once you understand the basics of programming, we can go and do a deep dive into the world of databases! I would recommend learning SQL and I think that is going to be enough. What I suggest you to learn is learning PostgreSQL which is open source. Here you will learn a lot about data storage, ability to clean, manipulate data, handling missing values, handling outliers, and many more!

- [SQL Course for beginnners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S_tz1z_5bA)

- [W3 Schools for PostgreSQL](https://www.w3schools.com/postgresql/)

- [Tutorials Point for PostgreSQL](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/index.htm)

### d. Machine Learning

It is not data science if we don't touch machine learning right? Once you have the basic foundations of programming, data wrangling, statistics, we can now begin the fun part! Machine Learning. By using machine learning, we can learn from data, do predictions, and make decisions. The 3 key concepts that you will need to learn here are Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Deep Learning. 

Here are some my recommendations of courses:

- [Intro to Machine Learning from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)

- [Intermediate Machine Learning from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)

- [Machine Learning Specialization with Andrew Ng!](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction/paidmedia?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=B2C_NAMER_machine-learning-introduction_stanford_FTCOF_specializations_country-US-country-CA&campaignid=685340575&adgroupid=46849728719&device=c&keyword=andrew%20ng%20machine%20learning&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adposition=&creativeid=606098666387&hide_mobile_promo&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAv628BhC2ARIsAIJIiK8evpdf4qXSmYEfDs0XxK1mAm2Nu8ZZQ1De_AFaCh32oKAVY9B9oC0aAvNyEALw_wcB)

### e. Data Visualization

![](dataviz.png)

After you make you gather your data, do some data wrangling, make your ML models, then what's next? You want to show it to everybody right? Here is where Data Visualization comes in! Data visualization is the art of representing data in a visual format (e.g., charts, graphs) to help uncover patterns, trends, and insights. Itâ€™s an essential skill for data scientists, as it allows you to effectively communicate your findings to others. There are a LOT of choices here, for me personally, if we are using python then I would start with Matplotlib + Seaborn if you are from a CS background, and if you are not maybe you can start from Plotly or Altair. For R, ggplot2 is the best one! 

Here are some my recommendations but I would suggest to go to their documentations:

- [Fundamentals of Data Visualization by Claus O. Wilke](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/introduction.html)

- [Altair official website](https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/overview.html)

- [Plotly official website](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/)

- [Python Seaborn Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-seaborn-tutorial/)

## 2. Start a project

After finishing all those studies, what I would recommend to do next is just start a project! By doing so you can apply what you have learned so far and get the fruits of it. I usually likes to copy a project that someone has already made and make my own copy of it! Here is some project suggestions to start [Data science projects](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-data-science-projects/). Another thing that I would do is go through kaggle, click a random project and see how they solve a problem. You can easily copy and see what other people are doing and it will definitely help. Trust me on this, if you don't understand it, it is okay, just try it, it won't hurt!

## 3. Stay Updated!

The world of data science and AI is rapidly evolving, new tools, new libraries, and new researchers are being made everyday, faster than ever. You have to keep stay connected with the updates, read forums online (Reddit is my favourite), join Stack Overflow communities, read news on LinkedIn, Youtube, and many more sources!

Keep learning! Build your portfolio, get that data science job that you have been dreaming about!
